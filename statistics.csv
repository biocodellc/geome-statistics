223,Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis invasion on California Islands,2020-01-15 12:09:45.013079,"Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), an amphibian fungal pathogen, has infected approximately 500 species and caused extinctions or declines in approximately 200 species worldwide. Despite over a decade of research, little is known about its invasion biology. To better understand this, we conducted a museum specimen survey (1910 - 1997) of Bd in amphibians on 11 California islands and found a pattern consistent with the emergence of Bd epizootics on the mainland, suggesting that geographic isolation did not prevent Bd invasion.

251,Bd invasion in Aneides lugubris and Batrachoseps luciae,2021-04-20 20:30:35.143829,"Mae Cowgill thesis title: Social behavior, community composition, pathogen strain and host symbionts drive fungal disease. Abstract:  In many ecological communities, amphibians are abundant as both consumers and prey, linking aquatic and terrestrial productivity. However an emerging fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), which causes the disease chytridiomycosis, has severely affected amphibians globally. Investigating pathogen transmission and susceptibility of hosts is vital to develop applicable disease ecology theory, but most Bd studies have focused solely on anurans (frogs and toads) while many species of salamanders are also affected. Our study describes chytridiomycosis dynamics and susceptibility in two co-occurring terrestrial salamander species (the narrowly-endemic Santa Lucia Mountains Slender Salamander ,Batrachoseps luciae and the widely distributed arboreal salamander, Aneides lugubris) in California where the same disease has decimated frog populations. We (1) conduct a retrospective survey of Bd prevalence over the last century from museum specimens, (2) determine present-day Bd prevalence in the field, (3) use generalized linear models to identify biotic (e.g. species overlap, group size) and abiotic correlates of infection risk, (4) investigate susceptibility of salamanders exposed to anuran-collected versus salamander-collected Bd strains in laboratory trials, and (5) examine the ability of naturally occurring host skin bacteria to inhibit Bd in culture. We find that Bd emerged, became established and increased in prevalence in both salamander species beginning as early as 1969-1971, similar to Bd epizootic emergence patterns in other species of amphibians in California. Our susceptibility trials show high mortality in both species (60%,70%, B. luciae, A. lugubris, respectively) when exposed to salamander-collected Bd, but no mortality when exposed to anuran-collected Bd. Furthermore, we found that B. luciae disease prevalence is positively correlated with conspecific group size, and distance to A. lugubris. Our Bd inhibition assays found that both hosts have symbiotic skin-bacteria that inhibit growth of the pathogen, which may help explain how these species are able to persist in the wild with Bd. We suggest that Bd infection dynamics plays a significant role in population dynamics of these terrestrial salamander species and that the emergence of the pathogen may have had severe, yet unnoticed effects on populations over four decades ago.",true,false,Vance Vredenburg,San Francisco State University,Vance Vredenburg,vancevredenburg@gmail.com,NULL,https://n2t.net/ark:/21547/Ajp2,"Vredenburg, V. 2017 ""Bd invasion in Aneides lugubris and Batrachoseps luciae "" AmphibiaWeb: Amphibian Disease Portal.",NULL,NULL,NULL,45,AmphibiaWeb's Disease Portal,"Motivated by the decline of amphibians globally and the growing understanding of diseases as major factors, AmphibiaWeb and the US Forest Service are collaborating to develop a community-based, online repository and reporting site for data on the pathogens which cause chytridiomycosis, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and  B. salamandrivorans (Bsal).

Most surveys for Bd report only the presence/absence of the pathogen. However, Bd has distinct genetic lineages that vary in geographic extent and virulence, thus reporting Bd presence alone is not particularly informative. Our study uses a custom method for genotyping degraded Bd DNA samples, such as those nondestructively collected from live animal or museum specimen skin swabs, and presents the discovery of a divergent lineage of Bd—BdASIA3. This study advances our understanding of the evolutionary origins of Bd, highlights areas of the world where Bd lineages are coming into contact, and opens the door to affordable, rapid genetic monitoring of this pathogen.",true,false,Allison Q.

Lake whitefish spawn on several reefs throughout Lake Erie, but the relative recruitment dynamics and contributions of spawning groups to the fishery are not well understood. Modern high-throughput sequencing approaches offer new opportunities to census population diversity and to identify subtle differences among closely related populations. We used high-throughput sequencing data to evaluate the genetic structure and diversity of lake whitefish collected opportunistically across broad spatial scales in Lake Erie. Using RAD-capture (Rapture), we sequenced and genotyped individuals (N=88) from the west, central, and east basin of Lake Erie at 120,268 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Lake Whitefish from Niagara and Crib Reefs (west basin) diverged from the three collections. Interestingly, these were the only lake whitefish collected during the act of spawning (late November), and all other fish were collected prespawn (August-early November). These results suggest that some lake whitefish spawning reefs may be reproductively isolated, though definition of these groups into stocks will require more intentional sampling during the act of spawning.",true,false,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,182,Genome-wide genetic diversity may help identify fine-scale genetic structure among lake whitefish spawning groups in Lake Erie,NULL,false,378,peuclide,peuclide@purdue.edu,4,96,0,96,0,0,0,96

492,"Historical and contemporary impacts of the invasive fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, on the Yosemite toad, Anaxyrus canorus.",NULL,"The emerging pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), causes a fatal amphibian disease called chytridiomycosis, and has impacted amphibian biodiversity globally. Amphibian declines were documented beginning in the 1970s and 1980s, and although Bd is implicated in the collapse of hundreds of species, many declines occurred before Bd was discovered (1998). Thus, the role of Bd is often unknown. In the Sierra Nevada mountains of California (USA), mass die-offs of three species of anurans (i.e., frogs and toads) were observed in the 1970-1980s. By 2010, Bd epizootics resulting in population collapse were described in two species (Rana muscosa and Rana sierrae); however, for a third species that collapsed, Yosemite toad (Anaxyrus canorus), the effects of Bd remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the historical and contemporary impacts of Bd on the Yosemite toad. We used a retrospective analysis to determine Bd presence/absence on 719 museum specimens collected between 1915-2005, and an additional 1678 samples collected from live animals in the wild (2004-2012). For the contemporary dataset (2004-2012), we developed a statistical model to identify biotic and abiotic drivers of Bd infection likelihood. We found that in the Yosemite toad: 1) Bd emerged coincident with historical declines; 2) Bd is currently widely distributed throughout the species range; 3) lifestage, elevation, and precipitation regime were associated with Bd infection likelihood; and, 4) the juvenile lifestage was the most highly infected, with some having Bd infection loads surpassing a mortality threshold identified in other species. In combination, our results suggest that Bd may have played a significant yet unrecognized role in the decline of the Yosemite toad. Additionally, we find evidence that Bd may continue to affect survival and recruitment depressing population growth and increase extinction risk in remaining populations, representing key insights for efforts to recover this species across its historical range.",false,false,Vance Vredenburg,San Francisco State University,Vance Vredenburg,vancevredenburg@gmail.com,NULL,NULL,NULL,CC0,NULL,NULL,45,AmphibiaWeb's Disease Portal,"Motivated by the decline of amphibians globally and the growing understanding of diseases as major factors, AmphibiaWeb and the US Forest Service are collaborating to develop a community-based, online repository and reporting site for data on the pathogens which cause chytridiomycosis, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and  B. salamandrivorans (Bsal).

To predict areas with greatest suitability for Bd, we created a suitability model by integrating habitat suitability and host availability. When we incorporated invasion history with high Bd suitability, we found that watersheds with non-native R. catesbeiana in the mountain ranges of the West Coast have the highest disease risk. These findings shed light on the invasion history and disease dynamics of Bd in North America.

241,Is Chytridiomycosis an Emerging Infectious Disease in Asia?,2020-02-19 15:15:04.68692,"Abstract Excerpt: To date, Bd surveys have been published for few Asian countries, and infected amphibians have been reported only from Indonesia, South Korea, China and Japan. Thus far, there have been no substantiated reports of enigmatic or suspected disease-caused population declines of the kind that has been attributed to Bd in other areas. In order to gain a more detailed picture of the distribution of Bd in Asia, we undertook a widespread, opportunistic survey of over 3,000 amphibians for Bd throughout Asia and adjoining Papua New Guinea. Survey sites spanned 15 countries, approximately 36° latitude, 111°  longitude, and over 2000 m in elevation. Bd prevalence was very low throughout our survey area (2.35% overall) and infected animals were not clumped as would be expected in epizootic events. This suggests that Bd is either newly emerging in Asia, endemic at low prevalence, or that some other ecological factor is preventing Bd from fully invading Asian amphibians. The current observed pattern in Asia differs from that in many other parts of the world.

After more than a decade since the first known epizootic in California, little is known about Bd disease dynamics in salamanders. Pacific newts (Genus: Taricha) are ideal study species because of their abundance, wide geographic range, occurrence in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats, and how little is known about Bd infection dynamics for this group. We conducted a retrospective study to determine the relationship between Pacific newts and the fungal pathogen. We tested 1895 specimens collected between 1889–2009 and found no evidence of Bd-infected Pacific newts until the late 1940’s. Although we estimate that Bd emerged in this genus and rapidly spread geographically throughout California, we did not find evidence for epizootic dynamics. Bd infection prevalence and intensity, two measures commonly used to estimate dynamics, remained consistently low over time; suggesting Pacific newts may not be highly susceptible. Also, we found the timing of first Bd emergence in Pacific newts predate Bd emergence in other California salamander species. In addition, we found several environmental and anthropogenic factors correlated with Bd prevalence which may help explain Bd disease dynamics in the genus Taricha. Pacific newts may be a reservoir species that signal pathogen invasion into California salamanders, though further studies are needed.",true,false,Vance Vredenburg,San Francisco State University,Vance Vredenburg,vancev@sfsu.edu,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0197710,https://n2t.net/ark:/21547/Avh2,"Vredenburg, V. 2018 ""Pathogen invasion and non-epizootic dynamics in Pacific newts in California over the last century"" AmphibiaWeb: Amphibian Disease Portal.",CC0,NULL,NULL,45,AmphibiaWeb's Disease Portal,"Motivated by the decline of amphibians globally and the growing understanding of diseases as major factors, AmphibiaWeb and the US Forest Service are collaborating to develop a community-based, online repository and reporting site for data on the pathogens which cause chytridiomycosis, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and  B. salamandrivorans (Bsal).

334,"Patterns of fungal infection in two threatened amphibian species, Ambystoma macrodactylum and Hyliola regilla, over the last century",NULL,"Beginning in the 1980’s, amphibian populations began to experience major declines globally. In western North America, many species are threatened.  In this study, we focus on two wide-ranging species that occur there: the long-toed salamander, Ambystoma macrodactylum; and, the pacific chorus frog, Hyliola regilla. Both of these species range roughly from British Columbia, Canada to southern California, and both have experienced declines. Emerging infectious disease is implicated as a factor in declines of many species but has not been extensively tested for these species. A global pandemic caused by fungal pathogens, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal), has resulted in hundreds of epizootics. While less is known about Bsal, historical studies of amphibians in western North America have shown a pattern of Bd invasion, epizootics, and population collapse. Therefore, we use a Bd PCR assay to test 815 A. macrodactylum specimens and 776 H. regilla specimens collected over the last 100 years (1810-2019). We find a low proportion of Bd-infected specimens in A. macrodactylum and H. regilla (<1%, and 5%, respectively) over that time period. Our data suggest that Bd epizootics may not be responsible for declines in these two species, however there are limitations to this type of museum study.

442,SEASONAL DROUGHT AND ITS EFFECTS ON FROG POPULATION DYNAMICS AND AMPHIBIAN DISEASE IN INTERMITTENT STREAMS,2021-10-21 12:22:27.589067,"Chytridiomycosis, caused by the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), has contributed to amphibian declines globally, but drivers of outbreaks vary locally. Here we explore the role of drought in population and host-disease dynamics of the endangered stream-breeding foothill yellow-legged frog (Rana boylii). In central California (USA) where severity of seasonal drought is increasing, we observed the non-native, Bd-tolerant, and lentic-adapted North American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) extend into streams when flood disturbance was minimal. Analysis of skin swabs revealed that prevalence and load of Bd infection among bullfrogs was low. Yet, among the native frogs, prevalence and load intensified as the seasonal drought progressed and surface flow became intermittent. When temperatures decreased in autumn and frogs concentrated at a reduced number of water points, we found dozens of dead foothill yellow-legged frogs (2018–2019). Necropsies suggested chytridiomycosis as the likely cause of death. Despite recent lethal outbreaks, foothill yellow-legged frog population abundance appeared resilient based on comparison to prior decades when no die-offs were observed. Wet-dry mapping of the stream channel and retrospective analysis of hydrologic records revealed that the native frogs spawn away from perennial pools, a behavior that may allow them to avoid bullfrogs and predatory fish. In an ecological tradeoff, tadpoles face the risk of the stream drying before metamorphosis. Fluctuations in population size thus corresponded to extremes of inter-annual variation in streamflow that limit recruitment rather than disease outbreaks. We conclude that hydrologic constraints, which climate change may exacerbate, appear to override the stressors of non-indigenous species and chytridiomycosis.",true,false,Sarah Kupferberg,Independent Scholar,Sarah Kupferberg,skupferberg@gmail.com,10.1002/eco.2395,NULL,NULL,CC0,NULL,NULL,45,AmphibiaWeb's Disease Portal,"Motivated by the decline of amphibians globally and the growing understanding of diseases as major factors, AmphibiaWeb and the US Forest Service are collaborating to develop a community-based, online repository and reporting site for data on the pathogens which cause chytridiomycosis, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and  B. salamandrivorans (Bsal).

254,Sierra Nevada Retrospective Analysis,2021-01-04 14:13:52.18501,"Abstract excerpt: In the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, USA, conspecific populations of frogs currently exhibit dramatically different host/ Bd-pathogen dynamics. To provide a temporal context by which present day dynamics may be better understood, we use a Bd qPCR assay to test 1165 amphibian specimens collected between 1900 and 2005. Our historical analyses reveal a pattern of pathogen invasion and eventual spread across the Sierra Nevada over the last century. Although we found a small number of Bd-infections prior to 1970, these showed no sign of spread or increase in infection prevalence over multiple decades. After the late 1970s, when mass die offs were first noted, our data show Bd as much more prevalent and more spatially spread out, suggesting epizootic spread. However, across the ~400km2 area, we found no evidence of a wave-like pattern, but instead discovered multiple, nearly-simultaneous invasions within regions. We found that Bd invaded and spread in the central Sierra Nevada (Yosemite National Park area) about four decades before it invaded and spread in the southern Sierra Nevada (Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks area), and suggest that the temporal pattern of pathogen invasion may help explain divergent contemporary host pathogen dynamics.

However, susceptibility to Bd infection varies between amphibian host species. In the Sierra Nevada, endangered mountain yellow-legged frogs (Rana muscosa) are highly susceptible to Bd. The co-occurring Pacific chorus frog (Pseudacris regilla) is less susceptible and has therefore been proposed as a reservoir host. Recent studies of amphibian skin microbiomes indicate that in some amphibian species, symbiotic skin bacteria may facilitate survival against Bd infection by producing antifungal compounds. At sites with different amphibian compositions, I will compare R. muscosa and P. regilla skin microbial communities to determine how microbiome composition may influence disease outcomes for these hosts.

Bsal thrives at temperatures found in many mountainous regions rich in salamander species; because of this, we have screened specimens of salamanders representing 17 species inhabiting mountain ranges in three continents: The Smoky Mountains, the Swiss Alps, and the Peruvian Andes.

503,The fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans is not detected in wild and captive amphibians from Mexico,2023-02-09 20:21:40.703482,"The recent emergence of the pathogen Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal) is associated with rapid population declines of salamanders in Europe and its arrival to new areas could cause dramatic negative effects on other amphibian populations and species. Amphibian species, present in areas with high amphibian diversity such as Mexico, could be highly threatened due to the arrival of Bsal, particularly salamander species which are more vulnerable to chytridiomycosis caused by this pathogen. Thus, immediate surveillance is needed as a strategy to efficiently contend with an emerging infectious disease such as chytridiomycosis. In this study, we analyzed 490 wild and captive amphibians from 48 species across 76 sites in the North, Central, and South of Mexico to evaluate the presence of Bsal. Amphibians were sampled in sites with variable degrees of amphibian richness and suitability for Bsal according to previous studies. From the 76 sampling sites, 10 of them were located in areas with high amphibian richness and potential moderate to high Bsal habitat suitability. We did not detect Bsal in any of the samples, and no signs of the disease were observed in any individual at the time of sampling. Our results suggest that Bsal has not yet arrived at the sampled sites or could be at low prevalence within populations with low occurrence probability. This is the first study that evaluates the presence of Bsal in different regions and amphibian species in Mexico, which is the second most diverse country in salamander species in the world. We highlight the risk and the importance of continuing surveillance of Bsal in Mexico and discuss control strategies to avoid the introduction and spread of Bsal in the country.",true,false,Eria A.

We conducted a pilot Type Locality Project to collect voucher specimens and genomic-grade samples from amphibian type localities in the state of Virginia, USA. These samples can serve as proxies for cases in which obtaining genomic data from the type specimen is not possible. Undergraduate students participated in all aspects of the project including fieldwork, DNA barcoding, and incorporating specimens into the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Natural History research collection. When possible we incorporated community-level surveys and pathogen screening for the amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) into our field protocols to provide students with experience in implementing these standard techniques. The Type Locality Project is an excellent platform for providing undergraduate students with hands-on research experiences and training in taxonomy and systematics.

292,USGS National Survey for the Amphibian Chytrid Fungus Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans,2020-06-24 11:50:37.067435,"This dataset provides the results of a national survey of the conterminous U.S. for the salamander chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal) conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey Amphibian Research and Monitoring Initiative from May 2014 to August 2017. Sites were sampled by capturing amphibians by hand or by traps or nets that were then swabbed individually using methods that prevent sample contamination. All swabs were then analyzed using a real-time TaqMan PCR for detection of B. salamandrivorans on the extracted DNA. The data consist of locality information and data on the individual sampled, as well as the result of the test for B. salamandrivorans. No cases of B. salamandrivorans were detected in this study.
